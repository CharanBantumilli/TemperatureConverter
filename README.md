# TemperatureConverter

# Introduction:
A temperature converter is a simple yet practical project that allows users to convert temperatures between different units, such as Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Posting a temperature converter on GitHub is a great way to showcase your coding skills and contribute to the open-source community. In this description, we'll outline how to create and document a temperature converter project for GitHub.
# Project Overview:
The temperature converter project will consist of a user-friendly interface where users can input a temperature in one unit and get the equivalent temperature in other units. The primary temperature units to be supported are Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
# Tools and Technologies:
To build the temperature converter, we'll use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are widely supported technologies that allow for creating both a functional and visually appealing user interface.
# Project Structure:
Here's a basic structure for your GitHub repository:
  # index.html:
              This HTML file will contain the structure of your web page, including the input fields, buttons, and result display area.
